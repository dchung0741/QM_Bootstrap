# Bootstrapping QM Systems

Follow the algorithms in arXiv: 2108.08757. I created an environment for bootstrapping general QM systems with high precesion.

The main function is in "Bootstrap.py". By inheriting it, one can apply it to general systems.

## Examples

The examples are in "Bootstrapping_QM_Systems.ipynb", where I demonstrate bootstrapping SHO and Hydrogen atom using "Bootstrap.py". The results are comparable to the well known analytic solutions.

I also apply it to the double well system. Where similar results can be found in arXiv:2109.06251.
