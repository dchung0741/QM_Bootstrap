# Bootstrapping QM Systems

Follow the algorithms in arXiv: 2108.08757. I created an environment for bootstrapping general QM systems with high precesion.

The main function is in "Bootstrap.py". By inheriting it, one can apply it to general systems to do multi-dimensional bootstrap.

## Examples

The examples are in "Bootstrapping_QM_Systems.ipynb".

I finished the Bootstrap for 

* Simple Harmonic Oscllator
* Hydrogen Atoms
* Double Well
* Energy Band

where my results match well with analytic solutions and results in [https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08757] and [https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06251].
